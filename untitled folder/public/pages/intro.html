<h1>Identity</h1>
<p>TGL’s grown and developed rapidly since its inception, and members are passionate and dedicated. We’ve ran events, exponentially grown our membership, and have a notable presence on campus. Despite this, competitive gaming still isn’t recognized as a serious activity by many—both students and administration. It’s also difficult to emphasize the difference between TGL and the Collegiate Gaming Association on campus, which mostly revolves around recreational games and discussion.
A consistent, distinct, and polished brand solidifies TGL as the premier collegiate eSports organization at our school, legitimizes it, and clearly sets it apart from all other organizations on campus. Moreover, our new visual identity reflects the values that our organization and its members hold.
